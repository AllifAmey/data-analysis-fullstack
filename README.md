This will be a full stack application with a backend/data analysis focus.

The frontend will be React and the backend Django Rest Framework.

The aim of this app is to practice data analysis with Numpy/Panda and to see ,
it's viablity in Django. As well as to explore Python on a much deeper level.

Another crucial aim is to allow me to get a deeper understanding of data analytics and backend development.
